## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

That's it! Everything runs within Docker containers, so you don't need to install any other dependencies on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Install Docker:

   ```
   https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sametalkis/ytdlp-web-ui.git
   cd ytdlp-web-ui
   ```

3. Configure the necessary files:

   - `redis.conf.example` Enter password in quotes and delete .example
   - `gui/env.example` Enter your own host IP or leave it as localhost and delete .example
   - `fastApi/.env.example` Delete <REDIS_PASS> and enter the password you entered in redis conf here without quotation marks and delete .example
   - `fastApi/start.sh` Delete <REDIS_PASS> and enter the password you entered in redis conf here without quotation marks

4. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Roadmap

I'm constantly working to improve ytdlp-web-ui. Here are some features and improvements I'm planning:

- [ ] Implement a light theme
- [ ] Batch Download capability
- [ ] Introduce cookie and proxy options to handle errors on certain sites
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and authentication mechanisms for the API
- [ ] Enhance video format selection with distinct basic and advanced options
- [ ] To make it publishable on the web
- [ ] Add more accessibility features
- [ ] Refactor the codebase to be cleaner and more object-oriented

I welcome suggestions and feedback for these and other improvements!
